 1. CODE FORMATTING ISSUES
============================================================

The current code does not fully follow standard formatting rules:

-   Indentation is not fully consistent.
-   Some lines exceed 80 characters.
-   Multiple variable declarations appear on the same line.
-   Some variables are not declared at the beginning of blocks.
-   Some variables are not initialized at the time of declaration.

 
2.INSUFFICIENT COMMENTING
============================================================

The following types of comments are missing:

A. File-Level Comment The file does not contain a structured header
comment including: - File name 

B. Function Descriptive Blocks Functions do not contain descriptive
block comments explaining: - Purpose of the function - Parameters -
Return value - Internal logic overview

C. Inline Comments Complex logic such as: - Registry enumeration -
Memory allocation - Auto refresh mechanism is not properly explained.


 3. SOLID PRINCIPLES NOT APPLIED
============================================================

Single Responsibility Principle is violated.

Currently, one file handles: - UI creation - Windows Registry API
access - Event handling - Auto-refresh logic - Resource cleanup

These responsibilities should be separated into different modules.

 
4. MVC ARCHITECTURE NOT IMPLEMENTED
============================================================

The project does not follow Model-View-Controller structure.

Expected separation:

Model: - Registry data access logic

View: - GTK UI components

Controller: - Signal handlers and interaction logic

Currently, everything is mixed in one file.

 5. DESIGN PATTERN NOT USED
============================================================

Facade Pattern is not implemented.

The UI directly calls Windows Registry API functions like: -
RegEnumKeyExW - RegEnumValueW

Instead, a separate abstraction layer (registry_facade.c) should handle
these calls.

6. FILE AND FOLDER STRUCTURE MISSING
============================================================

The project does not follow a modular folder structure.

Expected structure:

RegistryViewer/ │ ├── src/ ├── include/ ├── docs/ ├── tests/ └──
README.md

Currently, all logic exists in a single source file.

7. VERSION CONTROL STRATEGY NOT PRESENT
============================================================

There is no evidence of: - Git repository usage - Branch management -
Structured commit messages


8.TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT NOT APPLIED
============================================================

There are no test files or unit tests.

Missing: - Test cases for registry functions - Edge case testing -
Invalid key handling tests

 
9.INCOMPLETE DOCUMENTATION
============================================================

The following documentation is missing:

-   README.md
-   Build instructions
-   Dependency list
-   Architecture diagram (MVC)
-   Sequence diagram
-   User manual

10. PROJECT MANAGEMENT EVIDENCE MISSING
============================================================

The course requires:

-   3-member group collaboration
-   Task division
-   Project management tool usage (e.g., Trello)
